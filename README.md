#BattlePass XP
This Code is mostly Skidded Keep that in mind

This code could use alot of improvement and needs a bit more changes to work with lawin/momentum/alpha/reload.

The layout for the XP file is weird, easy to change but it works like this:

OGLVL - NEXTLVL = AMOUNTTONEXT
(eg: 1 - 2 = 250)

The Battlepass json layout is the same as lawin, if you make any updates to the code feel free to fork and show me.
